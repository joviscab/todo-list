# Odin Project - Todo List

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Todo List and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the OOP Principles knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Todo List Webpage, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The idea is to use all the knowledge that I have acquired until know to make my code a bit better!

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the OOP Principles skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this
Thank you for your interest! I'm still here, going deeper in Javascript, now I see things more clear but I know as well that I have to practice a lot, so another project here I go...
